# SnakeGameAi
Nokia phone snake game that can play itself using a pathfinding algorithm

I originally had the idea to make a game using pygame. I wanted to do something that wouldn't be to complicated but something that i would be able to add on to to make into something cooler after I finished the inital game. I decided to recreate the classic snake game that could be found on old phones such as the Nokia. Creating that wasn't too complicated and was fairly easy to do. I was having a fun time playing it but I wasn't very good at it. I had the idea that I could get the computer to play for me and get a better score for me. So I started researching how I could achieve this. I found a video on Youtube by TechWithTim where he builds a pathfinding algorithm in Python and explains how it works as he's coding it. He was writing an a star algorithm to compute the shortest path from A to B. I took inspiration from this and built my own simplified version of the a star pathfinding algorithm. Although it might now be as efficient as A star, it still can find its way to B. I am planning on improving the algorithm to be able to get it to make better decisions on where the snake goes, because I know that I can do better. Feel free to check out the current simplified pathfinding algoritm I have built in this program. Enjoy!
